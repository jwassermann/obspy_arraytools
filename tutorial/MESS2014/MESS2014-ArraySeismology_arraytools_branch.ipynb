    "To see the difference to the P-wave, the secondary arrival (it is PdP, the reflection off the D\" discontinuity) can be analysed with the fk-analysis: chose a time window from 17-dec-1991 6:50:01 to 6:50:06. The slowness range should be as before (in the range of 0-12 s/deg). The slowness values for PdP are smaller (while the backazimuth is very similar to the P wave) and therefore cannot be a depth phase or Moho multiple. If projecting the PdP wave back with the measured slowness, it turns out to be reflected off the D\" discontinuity.\n",
